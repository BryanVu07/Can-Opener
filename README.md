# README - MIE243 Mechanical Design Project

Course: Mechanical Design (MIE243)

Project Name: 
MIE243 – Dissection 3: Can Opener

Course Objectives:
This project follows three key objectives:
1. Hands-on Interaction with Mechanisms: Dissect and analyze a consumer product to better understand its components and mechanical workings.
2. CAD Skill Development: Practice advanced CAD features such as gear modeling, assemblies, and creating functional mates, using **SolidWorks**.
3. Design Modification: Transition from recreating products to modifying them based on new specifications, aligning with real-world engineering challenges.

Introduction:

In Dissection 3, we are tasked with dissecting a can opener, which contains a simple gear train. After dissecting and modeling the gear train, we will redesign the mechanism to improve its performance by increasing the torque output by 25-50%. This dissection builds upon the foundational skills from previous projects and introduces more advanced SolidWorks techniques, such as using the **gear toolkit** and creating **functional gear mates**.

This project continues to develop our ability to manage multi-part assemblies and encourages us to make design decisions about simplifications, accuracy, and cost-quality trade-offs.

General Instructions:

1. Divide CAD Work: Distribute the tasks evenly among group members to manage the workload and ensure skill development. Document your contributions for your individual portfolio.
   
2. SolidWorks Instruction: This week’s CAD instruction will focus on modeling gears and creating gear trains using the SolidWorks **toolkit**. While the visual accuracy of the gears is prioritized, for manufacturing, a more detailed design process would be required. We will use this approach for modeling the can opener's gear train and its support structures.

3. Dissection Task: The can opener contains gears and shafts that you will model after dissection. As before, protective clothing is recommended due to the grease present in the mechanism. Accurate measurements of gear teeth, center distances, and other parameters are required for the CAD model.

Deliverables:

1. CAD Model 1: 
   - Create a model of the **gear train** from the can opener, including gears, shafts, and attachment methods.
   - You may simplify non-essential components like the casing or omit non-functional elements such as wiring.
   - Gears should be created using the gear toolkit and based on measurements from the actual dissection. They do not need to have working mates in this model but should be properly positioned.
   
2. CAD Model 2: 
   - Modify Model 1 to meet the new design specification: increase the torque output of the gear train by 25-50% while maintaining the general size and footprint of the original.
   - Prioritize either **cost efficiency** or **quality**, depending on the group’s choice, and ensure that gear mates are properly applied to simulate gear movement.
   - Highlight the key changes made to the gear train to achieve the increased torque output.

3. Drawings:
   - Submit 2-4 views for Model 1 and 2-4 views for Model 2 to show how the redesign meets the new torque and spatial requirements.
   
4. Questions: 
   - Answer the following in a separate Word or PDF file:
     1. Write an **engineering specification** for the can opener's gear train, including details about the torque increase and your assumptions.
     2. Explain how you modified the gear train to meet the new requirements and provide the **original and new gear ratios**.
     3. Identify the **materials** used in the original design and suggest materials for the new gears, justifying your choices.
     4. Describe the **shaft attachment methods** and support elements used in the original design and suggest improvements for your redesign.

Conclusion:
This project allows us to delve deeper into product dissection and mechanical design, with a strong emphasis on **gears and gear trains**. By analyzing, modeling, and improving a common consumer product, we gain valuable insight into how mechanisms work and how engineers can enhance product performance through thoughtful redesign.
